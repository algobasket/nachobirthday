	<strong>What is NachoBirthday?</strong><br>
<p id="q1">Nachobirthday.com is a crowdfunding website where users can raise funds in honor of the celebration of life (aka the Birthday) for a charity, individual or community projects, or whatever they deem special for their birthday. We offer our users the opportunity to use the day they were born to make a difference in the world, and donors the opportunity to help their love ones bring their vision and dreams to life.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q2"><strong>How does it work?</strong><br>
NachoBirthday makes it easy to celebrate life in your own special way. Raise money for the things that matter the most to you in honor of your life. You start by setting up a campaign that states the idea you want to raise funds for. Add a short detail, pictures and video to boost your campaign, and then share it with family, friends and fans. At the end of your campaign, whatever amount you raise is available to you or your charity of choice. It doesn't matter if you raised $50 or $10,000! We just want you to make a difference with your birthday.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q3"><strong>What can I raise money for?</strong><br>
We encourage our users to be creative. You can raise money for just about anything on our platform. NachoBirthday is known as the "celebration of life". So the question to you is, "how do you want to celebrate your life this year?" You could raise money for a charity you love, or an inner city youth group that helped you when you were a kid. You could raise money for your books for college, or just for yourself; the possibilities are indeed endless. Whatever you decided to do make sure you are celebrating life even if it's not your birthday!</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q4"><strong>Why do people back Campaigns?</strong><br>
Most backers are friends, family, and fans who just want to support and wish you a happy birthday. Others are people who just really like your idea or cause. One thing Crowdfunding has taught society is that people give for their own reasons (logical or not). People may donate to your campaign simply because you share the same birthday as them, or you are from the same city, state, or went to the same university. In fact they might do it because you have the same name as them. There could be many other reasons. Don't complain; just put their donation to good use. The people who give are not so much different from the person starting the campaign. They too are looking to make a difference and support the celebration of life. Note* although life may be hard and tough at times there are incredible people all round us.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q5"><strong>Where do backers come from?</strong><br>
In most cases, the majority of donation will first come from friends and family. Make sure to tell your friends, family, co-workers and contacts about your campaign. Spread the word through the Press, blogs, Twitter, Facebook and other social media. Not only do you want your friends and family to donate, encourage them to share it on social media as well. Every time your campaign is shared it is potentially placed in front of hundreds of people who might be willing to give. Also take advantage of "word of mouth" which is still very explosive despite being in the era of internet. Make sure you tell everyone what you are doing. When people wish you happy birthday, take the opportunity to tell them about your campaign.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q6"><strong>Is it safe?</strong><br>
NachoBirthday campaign uses the secure payment encryption technology through Paypal.com. We chose Paypal to handle our online payments for its world class standing in safe online payment. Donors' online payments are safe, and money is stored securely until you're ready to request a withdrawal via Paypal.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q7"><strong>Does it cost anything?</strong><br>
It is 100% free to create a campaign on NachoBirthday.com. At the end of each campaign we deduct a 5% fee of the total amount raised. For example: if you raised $100.00 we will deduct $5. This fee helps NachoBirthday continue to grow and become a world leader at changing lives. PayPal's fees are typically 2.9% + $0.30 USD per transaction. Fees will be deducted automatically and you'll never need to worry about being billed.

Beware of other services that claim to be 100% Free - they'll actually charge your donors instead.
Contact us if you have questions.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q8"><strong>Do my donors get charged?</strong><br>
No, never! However donors will have the option to pay for the processing fees which will allow you to receive more money. This option is available to everyone making a donation on the donate/payment screen.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q9"><strong>How does my Charity of choice get its money?</strong><br>
We send your donations for Charities to Firstgiving.org, a secure credit card processing services for charities. Firstgiving then sends a check to the charity of your choice. Charities will receive their payments less the Transaction Fee. Charities will be responsible for taxes based on their net income or gross receipts. All donations are secured.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q10"><strong>What if I do not see the charity I want?</strong><br>
We apologize for this inconvenience. Although we have access to hundreds of approved charities already, we are still working on improving our list.</p>
	<br>
	<p>What you can do is set up the campaign to raise funds in honor of your birthday, and then inform your users on your plan to donate the money to whatever charity you were thinking about in the details.

Please contact us as well to tell us the organization or charity you wanted.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q11"><strong>What if I don't reach my goal?</strong><br>
No problem. Setting a goal is a good motivation for you to share your campaign, and donors to donate. But our goal at NachoBirthday is more about bringing awareness and doing what you can to make a difference in your life or someone else's. So regardless of whether you reach your goal or not, we let you keep what you raise believing you will use it to make a difference.</p>

	<p id="q12"><strong>Can people donate from their phones?</strong><br>
Yes. NachoBirthday is mobile ready and will work on such devices.</p>

	<p id="q13"><strong>How can I withdraw the money?</strong><br>
Once your campaign ends, NachoBirthday will send you the funds via Paypal within 24 hours. You then can easily request a withdrawal at any time via PayPal or use your PayPal debit card.</p>
	<br>
	<p id="q14"><strong>How can I share my campaign?</strong><br>
